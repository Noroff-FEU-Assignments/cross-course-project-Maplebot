    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">To counter cross site scripting i would advise the client to not use any unnecessary use of innerHTML method in javascript and filter the input as harshly as possible to avoid xss attacks.
      it is also important to sanitize the data that the application accepts, this is done through the sanitize-html package that is in NodeJS and there is even a sanitization of SQL code called an ORM or object related mapping.
      For securing the admin rights to the site it is important to also use two-factor authentication devices, one method to get it done is by using OneLogin or Okta.
      it is also important that the third-party applications are trusted and tested, this can be done through checking out how many downloads the application gets.
      To protect users from leaving valuable credentials in the browser for a long time one could also consider using an automatic user timeout.
